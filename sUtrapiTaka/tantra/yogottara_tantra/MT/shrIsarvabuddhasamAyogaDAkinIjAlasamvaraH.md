## Intro
The sarvabuddha-samAyoga-DAkinI-jAla-saMvara is a bauddha tantra of which 9 chapters survive in Sanskrit in a single pAla manuscript from Nepal. All 10 chapters survive only in a Tibetan translation. It appears to be at the transition between what the bauddha-s classify as yoga- and yoginI-tantra-s. It could be termed the most basal of the extant yoginI-tantra-s. Its name has been derived by combining two bauddhized names of shaiva vidyApIThA/ early kaula tantra-s (the sarva-vIra-samAyoga and yoginI-jAla-samvara) such that it occupies the entire half of an anuShTubh. 

It has sections explicitly directed at the subjugation of H deities: e.g., chapter for on taking H goddesses as “dUti-s.” +++(5)+++

## 10 chapters
Of its 10 chapters, we have 

1. Describing the cosmic buddha vajrasattva in a macranthropic form, embedding all buddha-s. 
2. buddha-hood attained through sukha and bhoga. 
3. The capacity to attract women irresistibly and fly in their company. 
4. Attain magical powers. 
5. The gaNachakra worship with the pantheon of six deities: vajrasattva, vairochana, heruka, padmanarteshvara, vajrasUrya and paramAshva. 
6. The use of human blood offering in a skull bowl, charyAgIti-s, initiation into one of the 6 exactly like the initiation into a shaiva gochara. 
7. Construction of the maNDala of the 6 deities and initiation into the maNDala-vidhi. 
8. mudra-s for the 6 deities and mudra-s attributed to the nR^ityashAstra. 
9. The longest chapter. Asana-s, mudra-s, smita-s (smiles), iconographic details, chomma-s, some mantra-s and charyAgIti-s. 
10. Mostly repetition of material from previous chapters.

## nATya-shAstra
It presents the theory that dramatic performance using the 9 rasa-s of the nATya-shAstra results in Avesha by one of the bauddha (sometimes a vajrified H) deities:

The nine theatrical rasa-s: 

1. Eroticism: vajrasattva; 
2. heroism: tathagata as a hero (i.e., performer of vIrasAdhana); 
3. compassion: vajradhara;  
4. laughter: the supreme lokeshvara; 
5. Fury: vajrasUrya;  
6. terror: vajrarudra;  
7. Disgust: shAkyamuni buddha; 
8. all wonder: Aralli; 
9. peace: ever the buddha, for the pacification of all suffering.

## Aralli
The deity Aralli in this list is rather enigmatic. Appearing elsewhere as vajrAralli (e.g., saMpuTa tantra and vajravArAhI sadhana; Aralli in rigyArallI-tantra where he is combined with his obscure consort rigI), this deity does not seem to have a clear H precursor. It might be a name acquired from a local non-Aryan tongue, making one wonder if it is a survival of a tribal deity in a bauddha guise.

## nRtyashAstra
Finally, the incorporation of the nRtyashAstra into SBSDJS could potentially reflect its shaiva inspiration. After all, abhinavagupta himself commented on the nATyashAstra with similar ultimate motives.
