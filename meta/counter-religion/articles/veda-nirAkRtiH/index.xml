      <description>&lt;p&gt;MHK 9.31 reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Thesis:] Moreover, it is inferable that this text, the Veda, is produced by an evil person, [reason:] because it [teaches such evil things as] killing creatures, drinking liquor, and telling lies, [example:] just like the treatise of the Magas, 225&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This verse, in accordance with Bhāviveka&amp;rsquo;s predilection for syllogism, consists of three parts that, taken as a whole, prove the thesis (pratijñā), that is, the evil authorship of the Veda (a-sat-puruṣa-kartṛkaḥ). The immoral practices of Brahmins— such as killing, drinking, and lying— are adduced as the reason (hetu) for the thesis. Lastly, to confirm the concomitance between the evil authorship and the evil teaching, Bhāviveka corroborates his inference with an example (dṛṣṭānta), that is, the treatise of the Magas (magaśāstra). Thus, just as the evil treatise of the Magas has the evil authors, (the Magas themselves), based on the evil nature of the Veda, Bhāviveka reasons, we need to presume an evil author behind the Veda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
