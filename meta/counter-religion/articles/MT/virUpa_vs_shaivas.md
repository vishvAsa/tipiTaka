## virUpa
> This is the same narrative the vajrayanists use for other siddhas like virUpa. He rises in the ranks of a shaiva monastery only to defect by destroying the shiva-vigraha while taking refuge in the 3 jewels. He then restores the vigraha by placing lOkesvara on its forehead


There are shared motifs in this narrative, the one we originally posted and several others in the bauddha tantra-s which have a recurrent theme of the bauddha take over of shaiva-kShetra-s and pITha-s. 

There are other tales of virupa descrating H temples and replacing the central deity with a heruka while placing H deities in the AvaraNa. One may think it as formulaic and recycled. But we hold that it preserved a kernel of historical truth even if superimposed on different historical figures. 

There is the well known example of the li~Nga descrated by the bauddha-s by inscribing a dhAraNI on it in Soro village in Orissa.

## goraxa
The tAthAgata-s make grandiose claims of their vajra-siddha virUpa desecrating H shrines and installing vajrayANa deities in the sanctum while removing the H ones to the prAkAra circuits. I came across a nAtha account in which he is finally routed and put to flight by gorakSha in a display of siddhi-s.

> Even (positive) Natha accounts of Virupaksha have him destroying linga-s. It's a very pervasive theme

Suggest a kernel of historicity regarding his acts thought things might get superimposed onto later event. Someone recently told me uttara pradesha CM yogin AdityanAtha was following on the lines of gorakSha in doing "shikast" of dharmadrohin-s.
