Pak Afgh central asia were buddhu - but fell to Islam -  
high fragility to invasion due to monastic focus, unlike Zoros, Hindus or Hellenes.  

B acted as a carrier for H knowledge (medical, divine etc..) in East asia - just as Christism acted as a carrier for modern medicine, science etc. in recent times. But generally, H (sans B confusion) spread independently in SE and Central asia.

## Prospects in India
In mainstream India, buddhism is (one of) the (small counter-)religions of outcastes and rejects (not so much refuge of the hyper-intellectual elites as it was before the Mo-s put an end to it). 

H don't see denigration of the Gods and nihilism as a win.  
The debating/ logical side of buddhism contributed to strengthening H (and even, Islam!) already by the time the beardos wiped it out; so that current H don't feel they have much to gain from it - except as "our dogs".
