For practical purposes, from the H perspective, they form a devatA-adoring barbarian nation, with slight echoes of the anti-vaidika bauddha counter-religion.

## Deities

- Locals venerate many devatAs, with a buddhist veneer. They thank and pray to them.
- Some are ferocious, some gentle. Some are in coitus.
- Representations - 
  - Little roadside houses (could be empty), with fragrant burnt grasses.
  - consecrated paintings (thangka-s) and sculptures.
- In the thiksey monastery, the fierce deities like yamAntaka are covered (so as to not disturb the monks' meditations) except before the annual festival. My theory is that they are covered so that they don't chuck buddha and just focus on the devas.
- A notable deity is the horse-riding shrIdevI; whom the driver thanked on returning via chang-lA pass.
- Animal sacrifices to these deities were common until the refugee dalai lAmA mostly stopped it all.


## Mantras and japa
- Many mantras seem widely used without initiation (eg. maNi padme hum of avalokiteshvara, tuttAre of tArA, mune mune of shAkyamuni). Flags and engraved cylinders help japas; and quite a few old folks may be seen muttering them on walks.

## Household ritual
- Daily household ritual includes burning some special grass and spreading smoke everywhere in the building.
- Devotees specially visit monasteries on special deays like aShTamI and parva-s. For festivals (eg. thiksey gustor) they wear traditional dress.
- Rituals are said to gain merit for the performer; who is then encouraged to benevolently give it up and pass it on for the welfare of other beings.

## Transmissions
- Social media (and earlier radio) is a culture carrier. Older folks listen to discourses by those like dalai lAma translated to ladakhi. 
- The ladAkh driver recalled seeing rAmAyaNa on TV, and hearing para-tibeto-turko-mongol epic "gling gesar" or radio as a kid.


## Clergy
### lAma
- bauddha vajrayAna lAma-s function as ritualists. They are frequently compared to Hindu "paNDits" (ie archakas and purohitas).
- They are highly regarded. They're engaged and patronized by villagers even for village festivals. 
- Mostly (as in case of hindu v1s), their knowledge is low; with the questioning clear-headed scholarly type being rare.
- Some are trained in tibetan Ayurveda medicine.
- Occassional special rituals include homas, mask dances ...
- There is some baba-ism. One sees photos of prominent rimpoches (=gems) everywhere.

### Monasteries / Gonpas
- Central shrines features buddhas and lAmas (the high ones have hierarchically heightened seats). Lay visitors sit towards the back.
- Daily chanting includes occassional bells, gongs, drums, pipes.
- The shrine rooms often have good libraries with birch manuscripts (and some paper books).
- Gonpas often have devatAs and their symbols on the roof points - eg. trishUla over a skull and drum.

## AtmA
Overall, for most people, there is no emphaisis on anAtmA / pratItya-samudbhava of 5 skandha-s.
