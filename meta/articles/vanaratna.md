> The fifteenth-century #Buddhist monk and pandita Vanaratna lived a remarkable life that unfolded across the length and breadth of South #Asia and crossed the Himalayan range. As a #teacher, #author, and pilgrim, Vanaratna

Y'know what's insane about this dude? Of the multiple biographies and chronicles mentioning him close to his own time, we have a contemporary record of the man from his disciple Go Lotsāwa Zhonnu Pel (1392 - 1481 CE).

"Life of the Great Paṇḍita, the Illustrious Vanaratna" by Go Lotsāwa Zhonnu Pel (1392 - 1481 CE) covering the years 1384 to 1438, from his birth through his travels until his second trip to Tibet; is the first part to Trimkhang Lotsāwa Sonam Gyatso's (1424 - 1482 CE)...

"The Life Story of the Lord of Dharma, the Great Paṇḍita Vanaratna as Told in His Own Words" covering the rest of his years in Nepal and Tibet until his death in 1468 in Kathmandu.

Both men were his disciples, and served as Lotsāwa-s (translators) of Buddhist tantras and sastra-s under him during his three trips to Tibet as part of his entourage.

Zhonnu Pel especially is better known for his "Blue Annals", one of the primary sources for a history of Tibetan Buddhism (within which he's also mentioned). It is known to us that Kunga Lekpa (r. 1448 - 1481) of the Phagmodru dynasty had access to and read Zhonnu Pel's "Life of the Great Paṇḍita, the Illustrious Vanaratna" before his ascension as a Phagmodrupa monarch;
...which is known to have inspired him to request Zhonnu Pel to draft an invitation in 1452 to invite Vanaratna (residing in Nepal) for a third trip in 1453 - 54 CE.

We know that Drung Namkha Zangpo of the Nakartse family of Yardok had been one of Vanaratna's patrons in 1436 during his first trip to Tibet (1433 - 36), and had encouraged Go Lotsāwa Zhonnu Pel to write a biography of his preceptor and present to him as a gift from the Nakartse, a copy of the Kālacakratantra and the Vimalaprabhā.

So we can narrow down Zhonnu Pel's biography to have been composed between 1436 and 1448, with direct access to anecdotes and memories from Vanaratna.

We know the work relied heavily on his personal anecdotes and first-person excerpts, especially with regard to his life in India, quite less so when it came to his time in Tibet where this man was an eyewitness and defaults to a narratorial voice.

Of course, the rnam thar genre is in many ways also hagiographical in its focus on spiritual miracle and enlightenment as the focus and telos of the work but it nevertheless is useful for details that we can be sure are explicitly factual and obtained from face-to-face interaction with the subject of this particular hagiography.
