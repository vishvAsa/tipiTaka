<p>[[0:00]] [Music] [[0:07]] okay i wanted to raise some thoughts and you know see see what what you gentlemen think about it [[0:14]] as well about the buddhist approach or a dharmic approach to [[0:21]] international relations and there&rsquo;s there are two [[0:27]] suitor references i want to expand on and one kind of general observation [[0:34]] the first is a suta on the the great mass of suffering [[0:39]] [Music]</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s in the majima where the the buddha talks and one one [[0:46]] verse about um beings will put on armor pick up sword and spear and hack and hew each other [[0:55]] leading to grievous suffering and death and the reason for this is sensual desire just [[1:01]] sensual desire - so i think this can be interpreted as the buddha giving an economic causality [[1:07]] for war that wars are fought for resources [[1:14]]. it&rsquo;s the real and uh any kind of um [[1:21]] justification that that the national governments give [[1:27]] is couched in high-minding idealism like like saving democracy or [[1:32]] you know whatever it might be but it really underneath it&rsquo;s always [[1:37]] they want land or they want oil or they want [[1:43]] perhaps they want a strategic position to defend themselves but it&rsquo;s always [[1:50]] a material resource based reasoning [[1:56]]</p>
<p>the other suture references is a very short suta where the buddha [[2:03]] is contemplating whether it is possible for a king to rule [[2:09]] justly without the use of stick and sword [[2:14]] that is without violence and mara overhears the thought in the buddhist mind [[2:20]] and suggests to the buddha well you have supernormal powers why don&rsquo;t you turn the himalaya mountains into gold [[2:27]] and you and take over the world and use that wealth to benefit beings and rule justly without sticker sword [[2:34]]. the buddha says i hear you mara go away and the curious thing to me is that sort of [[2:40]] ends without the buddha ever answering the question whether it&rsquo;s possible to rule without [[2:46]] sticker sword. so i think there&rsquo;s a real meaning to him not answering the question because yes [[2:51]]. yes i think it&rsquo;s significant well what do you think it means um i think it&rsquo;s [[2:57]] it&rsquo;s uh probably impossible for a king to rule without a sticker sort yeah [[3:03]]</p>
<p>and the third point i want to make is more of a general observation um [[3:09]] from my own uh study of history my my first intellectual interest was history [[3:15]] i have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in history and i specialized in [[3:20]] modern european particularly 19th century history and i one of the conclusions i drew from [[3:27]] studying studying that was that nation states in their relations with each other are [[3:33]] never moral they moral uh considerations [[3:40]] don&rsquo;t really apply that they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re kind of amoral actors [[3:46]] they like to pretend that they&rsquo;re being moral for the benefit of their own populations [[3:51]] so everybody&rsquo;s always presenting their side as being the good [[3:57]] guys and the other side is being some kind of evil bad guys that have to be stomped out [[4:04]] but it goes back to the first point these wars are fought primarily for resources for [[4:10]] territory for land or for mineral resources [[4:15]]. what have you or to or to in the case of say the case of rome versus carthage to destroy a [[4:21]] commercial rival there&rsquo;s always a material uh [[4:29]] cause underneath which is goes back to sensual desire [[4:35]]. so i think as as buddhists our primary uh [[4:40]] if we have any influence whatsoever it should always be into the direction of encouraging peace [[4:47]] this uh any kind of warfare is going to be a violation of first precept [[4:54]] yeah yeah this</p>
<p>but then uh you know the buddha himself is uh reluctant to uh [[4:59]] to speak out you know his opinion on whether that&rsquo;s even possible yeah yeah i&rsquo;ve considered this a lot it&rsquo;s [[5:06]] like um you know if you you have peaceful have a peaceful nation [[5:12]] and uh you know they they disband their armies you know they have no no armed forces any such thing [[5:19]] then uh all it&rsquo;s going to take is just one ruthless horde of barbarians yes and [[5:25]] that&rsquo;s it and that happened to some degree in india like when the the turks were [[5:30]] invading the the the buddhists were pretty much just exterminated the ones that didn&rsquo;t run away or or convert to [[5:37]] islam the the the hindus still had some martial [[5:43]] ideals you know like the mahabharata you know even the the bhagavad-gita you know it takes place on [[5:50]] a battlefield so they had some kind of martial heroes and some ideals of just [[5:56]] fighting to defend themselves but um i think um to some degree it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one reason [[6:02]] why the buddha encouraged renunciation of society is that our society is just [[6:08]] practically of necessity uh a messy unpleasant thing [[6:14]]</p>
<p>i agree with that it&rsquo;s like samsara is always going to be is always going to be imperfect it&rsquo;s the [[6:20]] nature you know first noble truth that we&rsquo;re all yeah and [[6:25]] human society is is can never be perfected [[6:32]]. you know the best we can do is is maybe have it uh use influence to encourage more [[6:38]] peacefulness and more uh harmonious relations but [[6:43]] it&rsquo;s never going to get to the point of where there&rsquo;s no violence and no [[6:49]] oppression occurring yeah of course the one famous example of a king trying to follow the buddha&rsquo;s [[6:55]] precepts and just be the the dharmic ruler would be ashoka yeah and he [[7:02]] disbanded most of his armies and freed most of the slaves even set up like uh [[7:07]] free clinics for people and animals and so forth and um i think i mean he [[7:13]] prospered you know his his kingdom or empire prospered while he was alive i think largely because people were so [[7:19]] blown away by such a saintly king because they were so used to the other kind [[7:25]] his empire pretty much collapsed within a relatively short time after after he passed away yeah and also he [[7:33]] inherited from his father and grandfather uh almost the whole of india and then [[7:38]] before he converted to buddhism he conquered the last little corner so he had the whole of jampu deep under under his rule [[7:45]]. so he had no no real enemies oh [[7:51]] yeah other than maybe some hill tribes or something is your point that uh it fell apart in a [[7:58]] short period of time because they weren&rsquo;t defending themselves enough from outside attack i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m not sure exactly why the empire [[8:06]] collapsed the way it did i mean it could have been that uh without uh ashoka&rsquo;s [[8:13]] you know morality you know his his uh faith and conviction and so forth that uh [[8:18]] subsequent kings just uh um you know it just didn&rsquo;t work with them or or something i don&rsquo;t know i [[8:25]] think it fell apart if i remember from internal dissension and revolts more than from external forces oh okay yeah i [[8:32]] didn&rsquo;t know yeah yeah and then that was when the the greeks invaded the shortly after that oh [[8:37]]</p>
<p>yeah so yeah it&rsquo;s like [[8:43]] a morality it&rsquo;s um yeah just you&rsquo;re mentioning the war of rome and carthage [[8:48]] it&rsquo;s uh yeah the third punic war was just essentially just genocide yeah [[8:54]] yeah and it was i mean rome prospered it was uh that [[9:00]] the romans were ruthless early i mean just about any any powerful nation got [[9:06]] that way through just ruthlessness so i mean that is somewhat of a paradox [[9:13]] i mean you can move to some tiny island and have set up some utopian [[9:18]] system or some such try to just be anonymous just be under the radar so that uh nobody [[9:26]] you know just be poor i guess so that nobody wants to steal your resources that kind of a thing [[9:31]] but um yeah it is it is a problem like um so long as you&rsquo;ve got somebody that [[9:36]] isn&rsquo;t playing by the rules of morality then i mean you have to pretty much [[9:42]] defend yourself or just go extinct yeah it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not possible for i [[9:48]] mean all buddhist countries have uh have standing armies it&rsquo;s not possible to leave your country undefended [[9:55]] and the buddha never recommended that right he said you shouldn&rsquo;t kill they never recommended kings just to disband [[10:00]] your army do not defend yourself do not have an army the buddha had never said that right no [[10:05]] no.</p>
<p>um there i know that i&rsquo;ve heard in in thailand [[10:11]] some of the some of the thai soldiers who are [[10:16]] um good buddhists they they make the the claim that they [[10:22]] love their country so much that they&rsquo;re sacrif they&rsquo;re willing to sacrifice not only their life but their [[10:29]] future life yeah that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing yeah we should talk about the law of karma yeah yeah yeah i have considered [[10:36]] something along those lines like in a dharmic society one more dharmic than uh you [[10:43]] know the average that um i mean you&rsquo;d still have to have standing armies but the the soldier could be seen to some [[10:49]] degree as a tragic hero who&rsquo;s sacrificing his own virtue [[10:54]] for the sake of defending those who can&rsquo;t defend themselves. yeah [[11:01]] yes complex karma and there</p>
<p>there have been cases historically of uh [[11:08]] um miss uh what would be the word like misa misapplication or misinterpretation of [[11:15]] buddhist teachings to to justify war yeah like uh the japanese during world war [[11:22]] two for example yeah that&rsquo;s one another one is uh sri lanka with the fighting with the tamils which [[11:29]] has been like hundreds and hundreds of years on and off um [[11:34]] you you know about the the sri lankan texts i think it&rsquo;s the maha wangsa that talks [[11:40]] about king dutagamini and it&rsquo;s like a chronicle of sri lanka [[11:47]] and dutagomani is a national hero of of sri lanka because he he led a great [[11:54]] uprising to throw off the um uh indian was mostly you know the tamil [[11:59]] based uh from india uh oppression of sri lanka they&rsquo;d conquered [[12:06]] sri lanka and he led a rebellion freed the country fought many battles and wars [[12:12]] and in this texas says when he was on his death bed he uh he felt uh [[12:19]] fearful that all the karma he&rsquo;d made from killing and then and arahant monk apparently you [[12:26]] know as the text claims and arahan monk told him uh of all those people you killed [[12:34]] only one had taken the uh refugees and precepts and one [[12:39]] had taken the the refugees without the precepts so [[12:44]] uh instead of killing thousands of people you only kill one and a half uh no [[12:51]] yeah that&rsquo;s kind of pushing it that&rsquo;s still killing human beings so so killing [[12:56]] non-buddhists according to this text was like no karma involved i thought you&rsquo;re going to say something [[13:02]] like his good karma for protecting teravata buddhism in sri lanka maybe some long-term benefit to that so it&rsquo;s [[13:08]] all very complicated isn&rsquo;t it the karma yeah oh yeah well there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s comma that is mixed [[13:14]] right good cut that is both bright and dark with good results and bad results [[13:21]] yeah i think uh maybe the best that a ruler can do especially in in like uh [[13:27]] warlike times is just try to do more good than bad it is sort of like in uh there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>i [[13:34]] think it&rsquo;s a suta where um you know somebody asked the buddha how to how to dispel bad karma [[13:40]] and he talks about the handful of salt if you pour a handful of salt into a cup of water it&rsquo;s so salty you can&rsquo;t drink [[13:46]] it but if you pour that whole that same handful of salt into a pond of water then after it dissolves you can hardly [[13:52]] taste it at all so just uh if you have to do some kind of bad actions you just try to [[13:58]] mix in as many good ones as possible to dilute it down [[14:04]] so i mean it could be that you have to have a war but uh you know it may be that uh you know your people are more [[14:11]] healthy and prosperous and you know better off because you defended them then having their their cities on fire [[14:17]] and so forth right and i think there&rsquo;s also degrees of degrees of karma like any act [[14:24]] of killing is going to be bad karma but if you if the if the nation is forced into into a war-like [[14:31]] situation they have to to fight then there&rsquo;s going to be a lot worse karma if [[14:37]] they kill civilians then you know like bombing you know [[14:42]] carpet bombing cities or or massacring civilians in any way rather than you know [[14:49]] warrior against warrior yeah yeah i might as well throw in uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s [[14:56]] one uh it demonstrates the complete uncompromising um [[15:01]] attitude towards ethics that if you&rsquo;re really serious in in dhamma and that&rsquo;s [[15:07]] one of the few jadaka stories i ever read is the temi jataka where the buddha in a previous life is [[15:12]] the son of a king and one day when he&rsquo;s like two or three years old he&rsquo;s sitting on his father&rsquo;s [[15:18]] lap and his father has some criminals brought before him and he has them you know he orders them to be executed in [[15:24]] really nasty ways which was the standard in those days and then he realized you [[15:29]] know if i&rsquo;m going to grow up and be the king you know he was the next in succession he was going to inherit the kingdom from his father then i&rsquo;m going [[15:36]] to have to do that kind of thing so he just made up his mind he was going to pretend to be a deaf mute for the rest [[15:42]] you know and and uh he just steadfastly pretended to be a deaf mute until his [[15:49]] father just gave up on him in despair and had him taken out into a forest to have him just put to death [[15:55]] and then he started talking and converted the the person that was going to kill him and people started coming to [[16:00]] him because he was so wise of course and wow pretty much everybody just renounced the world and moved off into the forest [[16:07]] and left the the city the capital city almost vacant [[16:15]] wow</p>
<p>i think a karma the big picture too if um see a virtuous country [[16:21]] was being attacked by another country uh in the big picture you can think of karmic results it could be the karmic [[16:27]] resultants from the past right you think of the big picture over hundreds of [[16:33]] years and over many centuries [[16:38]] i don&rsquo;t really like the idea of uh collective karma like a [[16:44]] nation of people having a having a karma like because [[16:49]] you know the whole you know this nation did something evil [[16:54]] yeah 100 years ago and now they&rsquo;re going to get their karma back i think it works on an individual level [[17:01]] you know anyway you can have the semblance of collective karma just by you know people would have to have a certain sort of karma to be born into a [[17:08]] certain society which they would you know there&rsquo;d be like overlap of a significant amount of [[17:14]] overlap in their karma if they&rsquo;re living in the same society yeah that&rsquo;s true yeah they would have to have similar [[17:20]] comma to be reborn in similar circumstances yeah i know karma is only individual but a top but if there&rsquo;s a [[17:26]] massive situation with millions of people dying i would say wouldn&rsquo;t all those individuals have the individual [[17:32]] karma that it all played out this way right yeah yeah yeah that&rsquo;s how i see it too yeah [[17:39]]</p>
<p>i think think of the example of ashoka this great kingdom like you said it wasn&rsquo;t invaded but it falls apart um [[17:46]] yeah i&rsquo;m just thinking like yeah with samsara and karma you never know karma is going to ripen within samsara and [[17:53]] the buddha saying the world is the average food agenda is basically insane like sorry just can&rsquo;t be controlled and [[17:59]] karma ripe and so you&rsquo;re like no human society can be perfect like you&rsquo;re saying earlier right</p>
<p>yeah [[18:05]] and consider the um the the myth of the the checkout of the [[18:11]] the wheel turning monarch which in the in the buddhist tradition is this is like the perfect human [[18:18]] society it&rsquo;s the this king who does rule without sticker sword benevolently [[18:25]] and provides largesse to the people and the only way this works is by really [[18:31]] super normal means first he has the wheel in the sky that follows him around wherever he goes [[18:38]] and the other kings are so overrawed by this wheel that they [[18:44]] submit to him without battle and then the way he gets the economy working he [[18:51]] doesn&rsquo;t have to tax anybody which involves taxation is based on violence and oppression you [[18:57]] know you have you&rsquo;re forcing people to pay something so he he doesn&rsquo;t have any taxation but [[19:02]] he gets uh jewels with the wheel to power the wheel they get jewels from the bottom of the ocean [[19:10]] and that&rsquo;s the royal treasury</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in your book do you have your book there to show the audience the [[19:16]] buddhist cosmos i can put a link beneath this video we should promote the book because i remember reading that in your [[19:22]] book that&rsquo;s i uh how i learned it i don&rsquo;t know if i&rsquo;m going to copy here handy it&rsquo;s good and future videos maybe [[19:28]] show it to your audience because there&rsquo;s a lot of work how many years did it take you to write that well five [[19:34]] wow it&rsquo;s like the only book of its kind really in caravan of buddhism the whole [[19:39]] cosmology in one book yeah i wrote an essay on the 31 plains [[19:46]] of existence but that&rsquo;s as far as i got [[19:51]] yeah so what else about international relations what can we discuss [[19:56]] like they would have never selected any form of government like he talked to kings and they talked to republicans right he never favored a particular form [[20:02]] of government over another yeah the only he would talk about um the morality [[20:09]] that ruler should follow but not any you know so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;ve got a republic or a monarchy or [[20:16]] democracy or whatever but if the people that are in charge should be following moral [[20:23]] behavior but one one other point that occurs to me to make about um [[20:28]] international relations particularly in times of war is the value of truth that [[20:35]] you know there&rsquo;s an old saying the first casualty of war is truth yes we see this again and again that there&rsquo;s [[20:41]] so much propaganda always flies around when there when there&rsquo;s [[20:47]] uh conflict and it becomes you know it&rsquo;s uh i i think as buddhist we should have a [[20:54]] um we should value truth highly and not uh [[21:00]] and we should have some kind of uh you know mental immune system against uh [[21:06]] propaganda yes yeah i think if you don&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t [[21:12]] uh you&rsquo;re not faithful even to conventional truths i think your hopes of ultimate truth are [[21:18]] yeah good point very small yeah yeah and also and just from the point of view of politics it does it [[21:24]] would be good for you know any nation to to stick to its you know it&rsquo;s treaties [[21:30]] and that kind of a thing yes yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a base that&rsquo;s a basic morality of the and they&rsquo;re i mean [[21:37]] they&rsquo;re the uh like i said the nation states are you know pretty much amoral but i [[21:43]] think there has been attempts to kind of remedy that you&rsquo;ve got things like the [[21:49]] geneva convention and the hague convention and there are rules of war [[21:55]] and nations will sign treaties and they&rsquo;ll have agreements and um so [[22:01]] i think there is some sense that it ought to be moral [[22:06]] but when we see the actual behavior of states in history they tends to be really completely immoral in their [[22:12]] relationships with each other yeah it&rsquo;s more philosophical and civilized i think [[22:19]] and i think that&rsquo;s in a way that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s sort of the way that rome was i mean they were fighting off huns and germanic tribes [[22:26]] and so forth and they were they were just as ruthless as just that they uh had a more developed system [[22:33]] and and in in a way you know they had the pax romana where um at least they were peaceful within [[22:39]] their own borders when they were strong at least at least it was that [[22:46]]</p>
<p>but i would also mention with regard to politics in the the buddha i mean there is uh [[22:52]] um you know a lot of emphasis on kingship you know like the the the wheel turning monarch and so forth [[22:58]] but uh with regard to the sangha the buddha did prefer a more uh democratic yes [[23:04]] consensus-oriented uh system yes i can&rsquo;t remember the name of the tribe [[23:09]] that he emulated with with regard to uh the sangha it wasn&rsquo;t the was the the malas or the [[23:16]] the bhajis or something i can&rsquo;t remember i think was the vaginas okay yeah the [[23:23]] the constitution of the same yeah and which is of which is uh [[23:29]] over the centuries has been kind of lost to a large degree is because most [[23:36]] of the buddhist countries have been monarchies yeah like in the thai a thai monastery [[23:42]] is pretty much an absolute monarchy with the you know that the top eye john is in charge [[23:48]] yeah it&rsquo;s the same in burma i wasn&rsquo;t quite aware of that thank you so that the head monk is in charge you&rsquo;re saying [[23:55]] yeah as a westerner i knew that i mean if there&rsquo;s a formal act of the sangha the most junior monk if he doesn&rsquo;t agree [[24:01]] then it&rsquo;s no go yeah but just unthinkable in in asia yeah they become sort of just like pro [[24:08]] forma they&rsquo;re just kind of empty ritual the the actual constitutional basis of the [[24:15]] sanghas they just become hollow rituals really oh thanks for pointing that out i didn&rsquo;t [[24:20]] quite get that like i knew against that power but how it contradicts the buddhist vinaya you&rsquo;re saying [[24:26]] well it doesn&rsquo;t you know that it&rsquo;s not an outright contradiction but [[24:32]] it&rsquo;s definitely against the spirit of it it&rsquo;s definitely shifted the spirit of it [[24:37]] because they still follow they still follow the forms but as uh um [[24:43]] pano says there that they can&rsquo;t the the junior monk would never dare to [[24:50]] use his constitutional power to uh that he has under under the vineyard to [[24:55]] object to to an act of the sangha okay he&rsquo;s saying like say in thailand it&rsquo;s been a monarchy for a thousand years how [[25:00]] about our tradition in charge tradition like stay with ash on omro and our head office [[25:06]] i find that with our westerners there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s more of a consensual base yeah like the the the monasteries [[25:13]] they do they the abbot is still in charge but it&rsquo;s more like a constitutional monarch and he&rsquo;ll [[25:19]] you know they they will for big decisions they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll have the you know [[25:26]] all the monks get together and discuss it yeah like all i give to shout out for asha and samado asha and ammo i feel [[25:32]] they&rsquo;ve been doing a great job of leading our sangha i mean we&rsquo;re the largest organization in the world of west western caravan monks right [[25:40]] yes by far probably yeah do you want to comment that i should put it on how how we&rsquo;re doing as a as a real song [[25:48]] consensus democracy compared to thailand well i wouldn&rsquo;t go i wouldn&rsquo;t even go so [[25:55]] far as to call it a a democracy either i mean it&rsquo;s a consensus right still there&rsquo;s still [[26:01]] as there should be there&rsquo;s still an emphasis on hierarchy that the senior monks are [[26:07]] are more respected have more authority than the junior monks but [[26:12]] but there&rsquo;s also a much more of a a sense of things being done by consensus [[26:18]] and um and try to have a harmonious agreement on on major decisions [[26:25]] rather than just laying down the law from on high although we have a big respect for a [[26:31]] seniority like sustainability i guess that&rsquo;s traditional as well like ashen&rsquo;s tomato he&rsquo;s been around since like 1966 [[26:37]] so he&rsquo;s a senior monk right that is a lot right yeah i think that uh [[26:43]] emphasis on seniority that actually does go back to the buddha and the original vineya that respect the elder monks and i think [[26:49]] that&rsquo;s a very skillful system because when you have any group of particularly men i think [[26:56]] maybe women&rsquo;s similar but in maybe a different way but when you have a group of men [[27:02]] in an organization they&rsquo;re going to be naturally [[27:08]] power struggles you know who&rsquo;s going to be on top who&rsquo;s going to be the boss [[27:13]] lyndon johnson and president kennedy yeah yeah [[27:21]] but the the uh the emphasis on the seniority kind of takes that the sting out of that because it says [[27:28]] you know if this if this guy&rsquo;s senior to you he&rsquo;s senior to you and you can&rsquo;t change that [[27:33]] yes it&rsquo;s more stable for centuries that way you&rsquo;re right in other ways there would actually be coup d&rsquo;etats some say [[27:39]] i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m better i&rsquo;m the younger guy i&rsquo;ve got better ideas i&rsquo;ll take over the place and this is my idea i&rsquo;ll put some [[27:44]] shop right yes you know sometimes in burma it does uh you&rsquo;ll have just a more famous monk [[27:51]] who is uh actually the abbot and they&rsquo;ll be like old retired monks you know who are kind [[27:57]] of dimming in their faculties or something that stay there that just because they&rsquo;re senior monks they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re [[28:03]] still sitting in back oh yeah behind the the seatto [[28:09]] in bueno it&rsquo;s like i mean there was a certain precedence you know it&rsquo;s like the the senior monk is you know he walks [[28:15]] in front and he gets first pick of the katina cloth and that sort of thing and yeah and of course if you&rsquo;re going to be [[28:20]] the preceptor of monks then you&rsquo;re pretty much their master like their father [[28:26]] i mean there there is that but yeah what sometimes happens in thailand if [[28:32]] you&rsquo;ve got a uh old monk who&rsquo;s starting to you know he&rsquo;s gone beyond his prime let&rsquo;s say [[28:37]] he&rsquo;s losing his faculties you know and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s still the senior one in the in the monastery he&rsquo;ll still sit up [[28:44]] front and he&rsquo;ll be paid like uh differential attention [[28:50]] but uh the second monk who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s [[28:56]] younger and still you know still vital he&rsquo;ll be the ones making the decisions and actually running things [[29:05]] that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>i was thinking more of a case of like um like there was chad miyata in in [[29:13]] was still alive and it was it like the the land was bequeathed to him [[29:19]] so it was like his monastery and then like older monks would come and stay there but still i mean it was his [[29:25]] monastery the land was donated to him and so i mean the the the corporate [[29:31]] um you know the entity of the song of the four quarters really kind of broke down [[29:36]] because you you had you know the leader who was the designated leader no matter who else came to the monastery who [[29:42]] happened might happen to be senior dan [Music] but in burma it&rsquo;s is there is a lot of [[29:49]] uh uh sort of ethnic corruption you might call it like like the pawarna ceremony [[29:55]] you know the at the end of the reigns where you invite other monks to admonish you and [[30:00]] in burma is is almost unheard of that anyone would actually admonish another [[30:06]] it&rsquo;s just yeah that&rsquo;s the same in thailand it&rsquo;s just a formality it&rsquo;s just [[30:12]] recited in poly inviting admonition and no one says anything and i asked three times and [[30:19]] that&rsquo;s it [[30:27]] young kid on the block yeah with regard to politics in general</p>
<p>i do think that um buddhism would uh are [[30:34]] the traditional theravada especially we just recommend that you avoid politics as [[30:39]] much as as much as you are able if you&rsquo;re able to just completely renounce society then go ahead and [[30:47]] like when i was in my 20s i just lost almost all interest in politics when i finally realized that what is right and [[30:54]] good from a political point of view is not necessarily right and good from like a dharmic point of view [[31:00]] it&rsquo;s just you know it&rsquo;s amoral it&rsquo;s just sort of a law unto itself and uh [[31:06]] yeah it&rsquo;s like you try to apply genuine morality or ethics to politics and it [[31:12]] just messes it up and it fails because the ruthless people are going to win can [[31:18]] you relate that to our topic right is this dharma and like international politics right i guess this is what [[31:24]] you&rsquo;re getting at there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a tension there between dharma and international politics yeah yes [[31:31]] you know when i go back to the uh again that the very origin of the state [[31:38]] was kind of a social contract idea that [[31:44]] people had degenerated to the point where they were starting to steal from each other and and that led to violence [[31:51]] so they decided we can&rsquo;t have this we&rsquo;ve got to do something about it so they chose one amongst them to be the king [[31:58]] and gave him the authority to uh enforce enforce good behavior [[32:04]] so it&rsquo;s kind of like a necessary evil like it makes sense doesn&rsquo;t it if people [[32:10]] weren&rsquo;t stealing from each other and and uh misbehaving they wouldn&rsquo;t need a [[32:17]] government if people were perfect they could just live if everybody kept the five precepts [[32:23]] you wouldn&rsquo;t need any government you wouldn&rsquo;t need a state you wouldn&rsquo;t need anything like that you wouldn&rsquo;t need [[32:28]] police you wouldn&rsquo;t need courts do you want to comment on these golden ages in the past that would describe [[32:35]] these like peaks where everyone&rsquo;s on the five precepts life spans go up to like 84 000 years what sort of government did [[32:42]] they have then do you think well it was before [[32:48]] i i don&rsquo;t know about the intermediate ones like when the after it&rsquo;s fallen [[32:53]] rose again it&rsquo;s not really specified um although no it is for the the [[33:01]] the when um the next time lifespans go up to 85 4 [[33:06]] 000 years there will be a wheel-turning monarch in charge [[33:11]] so it&rsquo;s again under that kind of perfect government but after that the monarch then purchased monarch yeah but at the origin [[33:19]] um when being started from this very high state they fell down from the brahma [[33:25]] world and they the abasara brahmas and they fell down to earth and they degenerated through several stages so [[33:32]] they started at a very high plain plane of consciousness and behavior and [[33:38]] immorality crept in and they kept losing their faculties and became you know [[33:44]] shorter lived and coarser and when they reached the point of actually [[33:50]] attacking each other and stealing from each other then they had to uh constitute a a government [[33:57]] to to keep order so it was seen like as a necessity because of the the [[34:03]] imperfect nature of man because people weren&rsquo;t behaving naturally [[34:09]] harmoniously we need someone to keep order so the king has the authority he has the danda the stick [[34:18]] which the word danda literally means a stick but it figuratively is used to mean serenity or [[34:24]] authority and you still see like in the canadian parliament the the parliament is only in session [[34:32]] and legally binding if the mace is on the table yeah you have this whole ceremony when [[34:39]] parliament opens these these guys in 17th century outfits parade in carrying this giant mace [[34:47]] and lay it on the table and that means problem is in session and sometimes they actually remove the mace [[34:53]] so they give an informal discussion it&rsquo;s not binding wow [[34:59]] that&rsquo;s sort of like the the roman dignitaries that would have the fascist you know the the acts wrapped in sticks [[35:06]] guys for them it&rsquo;s the same thing so sovereignty means the the right to [[35:11]] use violence. so ashamed can you give a dharmic [[35:17]] uh recommendation as a senior monk how do you how do you recommend the use of governmental force then in the sense in [[35:24]] the dharmic sense i would recommend that it be as [[35:32]] as minimal as possible and recognize that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a necessary evil that they can&rsquo;t escape [[35:39]] you know you you couldn&rsquo;t you can the current state of society you couldn&rsquo;t just disband the police [[35:46]] you know which of the you know the enforcement arm of the government how about the jails you can&rsquo;t [[35:52]] just let everyone out of jail right i mean obviously there&rsquo;d be chaos [[36:02]] but on the other hand if if people were encouraged to keep morality if people were keeping their precepts you wouldn&rsquo;t [[36:08]] need any of that that reminds me of our previous video on uh uh how terrible buddhism is not [[36:15]] politically incorrect in some american cities the political correct thing to do is defund the police right gotta have [[36:21]] less police got to defund the police because that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ll be correct how well has that worked out [[36:27]] you know the closest american city to me is minneapolis and it used to be a lovely peaceful city and now they&rsquo;ve got [[36:34]] huge because they did that they you know they put all kinds of restrictions on their [[36:40]] police and defunded their police and they&rsquo;ve got carjackings and which they never had before you know so terrible [[36:47]] buddhism is not in favor of defending the police so that&rsquo;s another way caravan bosom is not politically correct to [[36:52]] those folks well i i don&rsquo;t know i mean that&rsquo;s sort of such a specific political question [[36:58]] it&rsquo;s hard to say what you know any kind of official teravata position would be i yeah [[37:04]] personally i think it&rsquo;s a really foolish move but yeah yeah so essentially you&rsquo;re just going to [[37:10]] have to have moral inferiors taking charge of that sort of thing [[37:16]] yeah you know like the the punishment of the criminals and so forth it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re going to be people that aren&rsquo;t very dharmic and you know sort of like [[37:23]] the butchers the village butcher you know he&rsquo;s just uh this is just what he does and that you [[37:29]] just stuck with that um there have been attempts at uh sort of [[37:34]] some attempt at like dharmic violence</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s obviously heretical [[37:41]] from the terra bottom point of view but sort of like the the rinzai zen you know the bushido [[37:46]] there&rsquo;s like the story of you know there was this samurai swordsman and his his master was one of the [[37:53]] greatest swordsmen in japan and uh because he was one of the greatest swordsmen he was being challenged to duels all the time and [[38:00]] eventually he lost a duel and was killed and so his disciple um you know it was it was just a matter [[38:07]] of honor for him to to fight this person who had killed his master so he he searches him out and [[38:15]] finds him and challenges him to a duel and he&rsquo;s winning the duel and he&rsquo;s got this guy down on his back he&rsquo;s about [[38:22]] ready to kill him and then the the guy who&rsquo;s lying down there spits in his face [[38:27]] and then he gets angry and he&rsquo;s really he&rsquo;s really gonna finish him off now and then he realizes i&rsquo;m no longer motivated [[38:34]] by honor i&rsquo;m motivated by aversion and anger so he just stands up sheaths his [[38:39]] sword and walks away because he wouldn&rsquo;t have killed him honorably so something like that maybe might at [[38:46]] least take the uh take some of the barbarism out of it i mean there have been you know even in [[38:52]] the west in europe you know there&rsquo;s the ideal of the gentleman and you know you got the [[38:57]] the valor and you know courtesy and and you know chivalry and that sort of thing [[39:03]] so there have been attempts to have a kind of civilized violence [[39:08]] yeah yeah i mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s still from the terrebonne buddhist point of view i mean it&rsquo;s still you&rsquo;re just better off just [[39:14]] abandoning the whole system and living in a cave somewhere yeah [[39:19]] so happy ending that no one got killed um</p>
<p>nothing like that though if [[39:25]] if there was a dharmic nation a totally buddhist dharmic nation and they had like debt-free currency for [[39:31]] the citizens prospered i i would think in this world the jealousy of other nations would [[39:37]] invade to have an excuse to destroy the nation like ash and he said it can make up some excuse if the reason is real [[39:42]] reason is resources so this is a tragedy i think you&rsquo;ve had a truly dharmic nation that was really economically [[39:49]] prosperous uh other countries would probably come in and destroy it either that or there would just be so [[39:55]] many people flooding into the country to get to share in the prosperity that it would just tank the prosperity right [[40:05]] yeah just hang in this world with these international bankers and their compound interest debt currency any country that [[40:11]] tries like say libya have the dinar for instance like they want to have their own currency [[40:16]] separate from the international bankers and they were destroyed so i&rsquo;m saying if you had a truly dharmic country i [[40:23]] anticipate that&rsquo;s what would happen what would you guys think yeah i i think that&rsquo;s i think there&rsquo;s a [[40:28]] lot of a lot of truth to that you know they try and libya and i think there was uh [[40:34]] even iraq also before the americans invaded that they were they were [[40:40]] moving away from the um uh international [[40:45]] banking system absolutely that that goes back to uh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a slightly more sophisticated [[40:53]] variant of the wars for resources right it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s [[40:59]] it&rsquo;s like the rome versus carthage example that yeah merchant class wanting to protect their [[41:05]] their financial stake maybe you could say well this is a whole realm we live on this planet in this round the human [[41:11]] realms in this state this so that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some sorrow for you right i&rsquo;m sorry would knock down a really virtuous [[41:17]] country well that&rsquo;s samsara what can we say yeah it&rsquo;s not yeah it&rsquo;s probably as the [[41:22]] buddha said not possible to rule those stickers or you know it&rsquo;s that [[41:28]] it&rsquo;s the the the imperfect state of human beings i like what panabasa said a long time [[41:35]] ago in a previous video that the world is basically insane the average food is just insane so you [[41:41]] check out of society go into the forest and be a monk and you don&rsquo;t try to fix the world what is saying you cannot fix [[41:47]] the world so thank you panama you said that to me about two years ago it&rsquo;s stuck in my mind you know all you can do is try to fix [[41:53]] yourself and then at least you&rsquo;ll have like a little bubble of better better karma or something you know that [[42:00]] you&rsquo;re dealing with [[42:07]] so anything else no i think we&rsquo;ve pretty well done that one yeah it was the first time first [[42:14]] evening did three videos in one go so may 2nd 2022 has been a good evening thank you [[42:20]] ashan and thank you panabasa it&rsquo;s been a good evening much better yeah very interesting discussions [[42:30]] [Music]</p>
