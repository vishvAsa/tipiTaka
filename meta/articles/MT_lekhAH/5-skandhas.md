The tathAgata probably saw his H rivals as equivalents of flat-earthers when he proposed his 5-skandha theory.  But perhaps it posed more challenges to his own successors than among the H. Yet after all the dust has settled, it still remains a fairly plausible theory, even if not the most parsimonious.
