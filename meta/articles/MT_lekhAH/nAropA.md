While nAropA has also been said to be a firewood vendor, I think he came from an erudite background consistent with being a v1. As for scholarship of saraha, there is a recent publication of his doha-s with Skt bhAShya, but it is not in my possession right now

> Tibetan hagiographies like to play up Naropa as a subaltern yogi type, but it's not very consistent with the picture that emerges from his actual works, which is that of a very learned & confident pandita. Hard to say how much his story has been modified.
