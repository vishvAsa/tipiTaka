"doha-like" verses in the vein of those sarahapAda or saroruhavajra (these could have even been originally composed by him. Considered scriptural by vajrayANa practitioners, they echo a modern "rationalist" view of material of religion:

indrachApa-taDin-megha-  
vAtolkA chAshani-dhvani |  
nisR^itA nabhasA sarve  
punas tatra layaM gatAH ||  
tadvad vidyAgamA sarve  
devatAneka-koTayaH |  
chittAd eva samutpannA  
chetasi cha layaM gatAH ||

> Rainbows, lightning, clouds, wind, meteors, and the sound of thunder:  
all these are produced from the welkin, and into the same they disappear.  
So also, all incantations, Agama-s (scriptures), and the many crores of deities  
emerge from the mind only, and into it they attain dissolution.
