The karaNDavyUha a counter-religious saugata text states that after emitting the deva-s from various parts of his body avalokiteshvara told rudra who had emerged from his forehead (lalATAn maheshvaraH |) that:

> भविष्यसि त्वं महेश्वरः कलियुगे प्रतिपन्ने कष्ट-सत्त्व-धातु-समुत्पन्न आदिदेव, आख्यायसे स्रष्टारं कर्तारम् +++(इव)+++।  
> at the start of the kaliyuga he would be known as the primal god who is the creater & agent of existence in the troubled sentient beings.  
> ते सर्वसत्त्वा बोधिमार्गेण विप्रहीणा भविष्यन्ति  
> Those sentient beings are will become uneducated in the bauddhamata.  
> य ईदृश-पृथग्-जनेषु सत्त्वेषु सांकथ्यं कुर्वन्ति॥
> Among such ordinary people & beings a teaching would be made.

> आकाशं लिङ्गमित्याहुः पृथिवी तस्य पीठिका।  
आलयः सर्वभूतानां लीलया लिङ्गमुच्यते॥  
> It is said the sky is his li~Nga, the earth is its foundation.  
It is the residence of all beings, it is called li~Nga as all existence is his sport:

Now, the saugata-s try to interpret lIlA as dissolution -- as all beings dissolve into it. We believe that while the explicit intention of the buddhihIna-s is to denigrate the H, they are tacitly acknowledging shaiva ascendency & likely citing a real pAshupata scripture.
