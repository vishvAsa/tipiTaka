The mahAvairochana tantra is a bauddha tantra at the very base of the yoga class of saugata tantra-s whose Sanskrit original has been lost in India. There, the cosmic buddha vairochana teaches what he terms the religion of the “foolish common folk.” (translated from the Chinese by Hodge) One can immediately see why we see this as a counter-religion.

> These gods are great gods:  
they bestow happiness upon all  
If you respectfully make offerings to them,  
you will become fortunate in all things.  
They are as follows:  
Īśvara and Brahma,  
Viṣṇu, Śaṅkara, Rudra,  
Skanda, Āditya, Candra and Varuṇa,  
Kubera, Dhanada, Śakra,  
Viśvakarṣa and Viśvakarman,  
Yama, Kālarātrī, Nirṛti,  
Loka-guru, Agni, Vinata-putra,  
and likewise the goddess Umā,  
the Nāga-s Padma, Tākṣaka,  
Vāsuki and Śaṅkha,  
Karkoṭaka, Mahāpadma,  
Kuilika, Mahāhanaka,  
Sadananda and Ādideva.  
As well as these gods,  
there are the most excellent sages,  
The Vedas and their followers.  
The wise person should make offerings to them!  
Then when they have heard such words,  
they feel great joy in their hearts,  
and with reverence, they apply themselves earnestly to those gods.

Commenting on this, buddhaguhya takes a position comparable to the bhagavad-gItA and effectively even the H religion leads to vairochana only (translation from the Chinese by Hodge).

> People seek liberation through relying upon the self of ordinary foolish beings and upon the gods.  
> 
> Vairocana. Regarding such gods as Iśvara and Brahmā, and so forth, generally speaking, there are two types: 
> 
> those beings arising subject to karmic actions  
> and those that are Awareness Beings (jñāna-sattva). 
> 
> In this case, those gods are also teachers of the path to ordinary nirvāṇa the knowledge and attainment of the Bhagavat Vairocana, you should view gods, such as Iśvara and Brahmā, etc., as Awareness Beings emanated from the Body of Vairocana.
