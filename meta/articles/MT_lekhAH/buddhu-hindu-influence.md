> Also B influence on H yogis & thinkers of the time is notable (seen also in shankara, effectively a prachChanna-mAdhyamika-bauddha)

## virUpa conversion
A kali~Ngan and Mh/Kar mAhAtmya-s state that he was expelled by v1s for drinking beer. Typically the incident is located at bhImeshvara after which he become anti-v1/H

I've not seen Harris' paper but IMO too there was only one virUpa of note. I think he has however accreted some anachronistic elements from various layer of history. For example, I think he was indeed associated with the reign of the pAla monarch devapAla in the 800s. However, a later king govindachandra of RJB fame was tacked on to the story relating to his voluminous consumption at the bar. 

In a nAtha shrine in mahArAShTra, I came across a tale that placed his four sins in a former incarnation. 

In any case there is a broad contour that is shared by the various tales of virUpa across the subcontinent. My hypothesis is that he began H associated with the rudrayAmala shakti traditions associating him with ChinnamastA and perhaps some other mahAvidyA-s to a lesser degree. 

He converted to B and became an iconoclast of H temples. 

Finally, he likely returned in the very end to the shaiva fold. Most traditions place this at somanAtha while the Nepalis place it at pashupatinAtha, and the bauddha-s explain it away as avalokiteshvara. Hence, he seems to have been a paradoxical personality from the start.

## ratnAkarashAnti
> One is reminded of Atisha's statement that Ratnakarashanti was the last person to be able to distinguish Bauddha and non-Bauddha religion, which, though certainly not literally true, probably does indicate a great deal of syncretic mixing

In that regard it is indeed notable that ratnAkarashAnti as a siddha never figured in any H siddha tradition (unlike virUpAkSha who is an accepted H siddha too). He remains a strictly bauddha siddha AFAIK. This is despite the "syncretism" or bauddha appropriation beginning before his times.
