There are unpublished manuscripts  
that suggest that the bauddha siddha virUpa of anti-H disposition  
was a worshiper and siddha of the ChinnamastA/ChinnamuNDA mantra-s.  

He composed at least two prayoga manuals for this goddess  
with a homa performed using unclean substances  
whose mention would offend modern H. 

It appears likely, based on the royal martial rites, that he composed one of those for the pAla monarch devapAla (ruled 810-850 CE).  
There is some evidence that he might have been associated with a chief in central India (centered on mahArAShTra)  
when he was still a H yogin. 

Hence, it is also possible, he composed this prayoga when he was a H  
and retained his devotion to the goddess even after becoming a B.  

## sragdharA salutation
He opens multiple works of his with this sragdharA salutation to ChinnamastA. Some also recite it before reciting the ChinnamastA stotra:

> नाभौ शुभ्रारविन्दं, तद्-उपरि विमलं मण्डलं चण्ड-रश्मेः  
संसारस्यैक-सारा त्रिभुवन-जननी धर्म-वर्त्मोदया या ।  
तस्मिन् मध्ये त्रि-मार्गे त्रितय-तनु-धरां छिन्न-मस्ता-प्रशस्तां  
तां **वन्दे** ज्ञान-रूपां मरण-भय-हरां योगिनीं योग-मुद्राम् ॥

> In the navel resides a beautiful white lotus, and above it, the stainless disc of the fierce-rayed sun.  
She who is the singular essence of saMsara, the mother of the three worlds, from whom the path of Dharma arises;  
Within that place, where the three paths meet, I bow to her: ChinnamastA, the Praised, who presents as three bodies (vajravairochanI, DAkinI and varNinI)  
I salute that yoginI, the form of knowledge, the seal of yoga, who destroys the fear of death.
