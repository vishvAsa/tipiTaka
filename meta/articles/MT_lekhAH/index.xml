      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/04/30/mysterious-early-maha-chinacharya-s/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the chInas have had contact with the Indians over a&#xA;long period and have imbibed various forms of Hindu thought. It is also&#xA;well-known that the bauddha influence on the chIna-s was profound from&#xA;the early phase of the foreign expansion of the bauddha-mata.&#xA;Especially, the emphasis on the desha-bhASha as against the deva-bhASha&#xA;in the transmission of the early bauddha doctrine resulted in a profound&#xA;change amongst the chIna-s, which corressponded to the shift from the&#xA;peculiar literary chIna-bhAsha to the colloquial chIna-bhASha, with&#xA;incorporation of indic terminology in translation. We distinguish the&#xA;spread of mahA-chInAchAra, from the early layer of bauddha spread,&#xA;because unlike that layer, it used saMskR^itaM as the main vehicle of&#xA;transmission. While the chInA-s and their Indian teachers definitely&#xA;used Chinese translations for explaining the texts to the native&#xA;chIna-s, Sanskrit with its paNinian grammar was the principle ritual&#xA;language. Secondly chInAchAra despite being borne in the garb of the&#xA;nAstIka bauddha-mata principally focussed on Hindu deities and ritual&#xA;beneath this garb. These features along with the biographical allusions&#xA;regarding chInAchAryas from India suggest that they were primarily&#xA;brAhmaNa or kShatriya scholars who had fallen to the nAstIka mata and&#xA;carried their internal tantric tradition relatively unchanged, just like&#xA;nAgArjuna, the nAstIka savant. This basic pattern lead me to investigate&#xA;the issue of the earliest texts of mahA-chInAchAra (in the middle China)&#xA;and the upa-chInAchAra-s (not of so much of later Tibet, but those of&#xA;the Turko-Mongol khaganates of Central Asia).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But perhaps it posed more challenges to his own successors than among the H. Yet after all the dust has settled, it still remains a fairly plausible theory, even if not the most parsimonious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In some ways it acted no different from the west Asian counter- religions, clearly establishing the shared ugliness across these movements. Lama Agvan dordchiev remarked that &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the conversion of various nations [to the nAstikamata] has to be different; while one will be converted by mere discipline, others are to be subdued by magic powers, i.e., terror.&amp;rdquo; Sounds familiar? To things recommended by the Lamaistic documents in this regard are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Counter religion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The mahAvairochana tantra is a bauddha tantra at the very base of the yoga class of saugata tantra-s whose Sanskrit original has been lost in India. There, the cosmic buddha vairochana teaches what he terms the religion of the “foolish common folk.” (translated from the Chinese by Hodge) One can immediately see why we see this as a counter-religion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These gods are great gods:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;they bestow happiness upon all&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you respectfully make offerings to them,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;you will become fortunate in all things.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They are as follows:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Īśvara and Brahma,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Viṣṇu, Śaṅkara, Rudra,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Skanda, Āditya, Candra and Varuṇa,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Kubera, Dhanada, Śakra,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Viśvakarṣa and Viśvakarman,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Yama, Kālarātrī, Nirṛti,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Loka-guru, Agni, Vinata-putra,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and likewise the goddess Umā,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the Nāga-s Padma, Tākṣaka,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Vāsuki and Śaṅkha,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Karkoṭaka, Mahāpadma,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Kuilika, Mahāhanaka,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sadananda and Ādideva.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As well as these gods,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;there are the most excellent sages,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Vedas and their followers.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The wise person should make offerings to them!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Then when they have heard such words,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;they feel great joy in their hearts,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and with reverence, they apply themselves earnestly to those gods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DAkinI plagiarism</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/tipiTaka/meta/articles/MT_lekhAH/DAkinI-plagiarism/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/tipiTaka/meta/articles/MT_lekhAH/DAkinI-plagiarism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been known for some time that the last layer of bauddha tantra composition, yoginI tantra collection, heavily plagiarized material from the shaiva bhairava-srotas and its kaula evolutes. However, while the term “yoginI” or “yogeshvarI” is the most commonly used for the goddesses of the corresponding shaiva system, the bauddha-s use the term DAkinI for their equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is notable that in the early extant shaiva tantra-s, the terms like DAkinI and shAkinI are primarily used for malevolent deities, and they are not the focus of yAga-s of those systems. They might have a primarily negative connotation in these texts: e.g., the Damara-tantra-s (uDDAmareshvara, like affiliated with the bhUtasrotas) invoke chaNDeshvara to suppress the DAkinI-s and ghosts. We have comparable counter-DAkinI spells invoking unmatta-bhairava in the eponymous bhairava-tantra. However, DAkinI and shAkinI also appear as the names of kula-s yoginI-s in the vidyApITha class of tantras in the bhairava srotas, but even there, they retain a malevolent character and are not the most prominent group of yoginI-s receiving high worship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To what would you attribute the resilience of the Jaina counter religionists in surviving the marUnmata onslaught over their saugata rivals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is only hypothesis but I have some support for it: I think by the time the bauddha-s fell to marUnmAda they were a very elite religion with little lay support and heavy dependency on royal patronage. In contrast, jaina-s had a more distributed support among the spread out trader communities. The former support system died with Islam the latter survived&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It seems to belong to the bauddha yoga-tantra class (for classification see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/nastika-notes-2/&#34;&gt;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/nastika-notes-2/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and features some of the anti-shiva rants that typify the developing body of the later bauddha tantra-s.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It also seems to incorporate material from the kaula tradition but in a rather unusual form (Gentry&amp;rsquo;s translation from the Tibetan):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In it the cosmic buddha of sukhAvatI vyUha declared that the H goddess mahAdevI would become a future buddha &amp;amp; called upon the saMgha &amp;amp; others to worship her with a 108 names.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One has to ask if it was a missionary ploy on part of the bauddha-s to appropriate mahAdevI or whether they simply could not avoid the growing H influence and had to simply accommodate it saying it was being sanctioned by the cosmic buddha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>rupAvalIya</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/tipiTaka/meta/articles/MT_lekhAH/rUpAvalIya/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/tipiTaka/meta/articles/MT_lekhAH/rUpAvalIya/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We first heard of a lankan text termed the rupAvalIya written in the 1000s of CE in a vulgar register of saMskR^ita in the works of Coomaraswamy Ananda. He thought is a H text. It has never been published but snippets have been described by him &amp;amp; lankan authors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that it is text descending from a H smArta-shilpa source (perhaps of kali~Ngan vintage) that has been reworked into a bauddha context. That is clear because it devotes considerable detail to the iconography of avalokiteshvara in his different forms popular in old lanka. But this bauddha deity is embedded within an extensive iconographic account covering sarasvatI; brahman; various forms of rudra &amp;amp; rudrANI; skanda&amp;amp; vinAyaka; various vibhava-s of viShNu&amp;amp; lakShmI &amp;amp; interestingly vaTuka. Thus it is mostly standard smArta type rUpamaNDana but the emphasis on vaTuka-bhairava independent of skanda is notable &amp;amp; points to a lateral influence from a kaula tradition. It also gives the specifications of other ornamental figures like makara-s, horses, elephants&amp;amp; the like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The karaNDavyUha a counter-religious saugata text states that after emitting the deva-s from various parts of his body avalokiteshvara told rudra who had emerged from his forehead (lalATAn maheshvaraH |) that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;भविष्यसि त्वं महेश्वरः कलियुगे प्रतिपन्ने कष्ट-सत्त्व-धातु-समुत्पन्न आदिदेव, आख्यायसे स्रष्टारं कर्तारम् +++(इव)+++।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;at the start of the kaliyuga he would be known as the primal god who is the creater &amp;amp; agent of existence in the troubled sentient beings.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ते सर्वसत्त्वा बोधिमार्गेण विप्रहीणा भविष्यन्ति&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Those sentient beings are will become uneducated in the bauddhamata.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;य ईदृश-पृथग्-जनेषु सत्त्वेषु सांकथ्यं कुर्वन्ति॥&#xA;Among such ordinary people &amp;amp; beings a teaching would be made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The monastic nAstika ultimately had little to offer to the masses despite claiming to be vehicle for the alleviation of duHkha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
