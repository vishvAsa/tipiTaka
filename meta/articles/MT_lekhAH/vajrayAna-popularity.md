> For every hundred students there are a thousand teachers,  
And nobody listens to the divine dharma.  
For every village, there are ten masters,  
And the number of vajra assistants is uncountable

Translation of a Tibetan verse from Dunhuang by van Schaik
Show how unpopular the old the old school bikShu-oriented tAthAgatan tradition was relative the rising vajrayAna imitations of H tradition. The monastic nAstika ultimately had little to offer to the masses despite claiming to be vehicle for the alleviation of duHkha.
